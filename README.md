### **Niu Niu Calculator (Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS)** 
A simple card game calculator I developed just for fun, using simple python, and front end skills to deploy on web.
I came up with this idea because I have a hard time calculating my card during the game.. This calculator helped me a lot LOL

## 🗄️ Data Structure & Algorithms
### **Suffix Tree Implementation (Python)**
This project demonstrates my skills in the understanding and knowledge on algorithms as we implemented the data structure from scratch individually.
This is an algorithm that simply checks from a string whether in any parts of the string matches the pattern, given at most one edit. An edit can only be either:
- Transposition
- Substitution
- Insertion
- Deletion

#### For Example:
##### string = "abdcabxdcyabcdzabxcd"
##### pattern = "abcd"
- at index 0: abd -> [insert 'c'] -> abcd / abdc -> [transpose 'dc'] -> abcd 
- at index 1: NO possible edit.
- at index 4: abxd -> [sub'x'->'c'] -> abcd
- and so on...
